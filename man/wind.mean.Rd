\title{
Wind-data mean
}
\description{
wind.mean computes the mean (average) of a time series dataset of winds in the same region. To do this, wind.mean uses U and V vector components of several wind data.frames stored in a list. Note that, if you want to perform wind direction and speed average, first you should calculate the mean of U and V components and then transform it to direction and speed using wind.fit function from rWind package.
}
\usage{
wind.mean(wind_series)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{wind_series}{
A list of data.frames downloaded by wind.dl function.
}
}

\value{
A data.frame with a similar format as resulted by wind.dl, prepared to be transformed by wind.fit.

\examples{
# First, you should create an empty list to store all the data

# wind_series<- list()

# Then, you can use a wind.dl inside a for-in loop to download and store wind data of
# the January 3rd 2015 at several hours around New Zealand.

# t<-c(00 , 03 , 06 , 09 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21)
# for (tt in 1:8){
#  w<-wind.dl(2015,1,3,t[tt],164,179,-48,-33)
#  wind_series[[tt]]<-w
# }

data(wind_series)

# Finally, you can implement wind.mean and wind.fit to compute the average of all winds
# datasets in the list:

wind_average<- wind.mean(wind_series)

# wind.fit(wind_average)
