\title{
Wind-data fit
}
\description{
wind.fit is used to transform a data.frame obtained from wind.dl. wind.fit applies trigonometry tools to transform U and V vector wind components in wind direction and speed features. It also transforms 0-360 longitude notation obtained from GFS data into -180/180 longitude notation to be used in GIS (Geographic Information Systems) or R plotting. Moreover, it cleans column names obtained from wind.dl, deletes "time" column and sorts the data by latitude.
}
\usage{
wind.fit(X)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{X}{data.frame generated by wind.dl function from rWind package.
}
}

\value{
A data.frame prepared to be plotted by R or to be exported as a CSV file to be used with a GIS software.

\note{
If you want to calculate wind average from multiple wind datasets using wind.mean function, you should use U and V vector components rather than speed and direction values. Please, perform the calculations through wind.mean directly from the result of wind.dl function before of running wind.fit

# Download wind for Iberian Peninsula region at 2015, February 12, 00:00
